This project is part of the Pixel Perfect Tutorial: Create an Amazing 3D Parallax Website | HTML/CSS/JS + GSAP Explained (2025)

## ‚ú® Description

Want a cinematic 3D parallax hero without WebGL or Three.js? In this step-by-step tutorial, we‚Äôll build a fully responsive scene using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with GSAP powering a smooth introduction animation. You‚Äôll learn how to layer images, control depth using data attributes, and map mouse movement to perspective, rotation, and Z-parallax for a realistic 3D feel.

---

## üõ†Ô∏èWhat You‚Äôll Learn

This project uses the following techniques:

- Image layering strategy for mountains, fog, and text to simulate depth.

- Using data attributes to control speed, distance (Z), and rotation.

- Mouse-controlled transformations: perspective, X/Y translation, Y rotation, and Z translation.

- GSAP timeline for a clean, cinematic loading sequence.

- Responsive adjustments to keep the hero section readable across different screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏èRequirements

- Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS & React.

- GSAP (CDN: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.x/gsap.min.js).

- Layered images (background, far mountains, mid mountains, fog, text/foreground).
